# Pedestrian and Bicyclist Safety in San Antonio: Identifying Areas Suitable for New Safety Measures

    This project seeks to identify areas suitable for speed humps, bike facilities, and walking trails as a means of counteracting pedestrian and bicyclist injuries in San Antonio, TX. For the purpose of this project, the term “safety measure(s)” refers to speed humps, bike facilities, and/or walking trails. The project begins with an exploration and visualization of existing safety measures. To analyze the benefits of these existing safety measures, an analysis of pedestrian and bicyclist injury incidents that occurred within close proximity of a safety measure is done through buffering methods. The project will then visualize injury incidents to reveal clusters or “hot spots” of these incidents – these clusters will represent areas that are suitable for future safety measure installation (if none already exist there).

    Ultimately, this project seeks to identify areas of concern (high incident occurrence) for further study, to promote future improvements, to encourage community engagement between residents and policymakers, and to drive informed decisions in local government.
